# Mobile Navigation Menu Implementation Progress

## Test Development
- ✅ Created unit tests for mobile navigation in `tests/unit/components/nav.unit.test.tsx`
- 📝 Tests cover:
  - Sidebar toggle functionality
  - Overlay behavior
  - Close button functionality
  - Accessibility attributes
  - ✅ Menu button visibility on all pages, particularly the "All Agents" page
  - ✅ Fixed positioning and z-index tests to ensure menu button is always visible

## Implementation Tasks
- ✅ Updated `components/nav.tsx` with mobile navigation enhancements:
  - Added overlay component that appears behind the sidebar
  - Modified sidebar to use fixed width instead of full width
  - Added close button within the sidebar
  - Improved accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
  - Enhanced transitions with smoother animations
  - Added keyboard support (ESC key to close)
  - ✅ Ensured menu button is always visible with improved z-index (changed from z-20 to z-50)
  - ✅ Fixed positioning of menu button to ensure it doesn't get obscured by other elements

## Validation
- ✅ All tests pass for the Nav component
- ✅ No regressions in other tests
- ✅ Fixed ESLint warning in test file
- ✅ Verified menu button is correctly visible on all pages, especially the "All Agents" page
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite confirms button is always accessible with proper z-index

## Notes
- Followed TDD approach - tests were created before implementation
- Implemented minimal changes to existing code
- Improved user experience while maintaining current design language
- Enhanced accessibility through ARIA attributes and keyboard support
- ✅ Fixed critical visibility issue with the hamburger menu on mobile views
- ✅ Used test-first approach to identify and fix z-index and positioning problems
