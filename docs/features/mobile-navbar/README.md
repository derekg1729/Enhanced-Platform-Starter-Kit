# Mobile Navigation Enhancement

## Overview
This feature improves the mobile navigation experience in the application, addressing the issue where the navigation menu disappears on mobile devices (or narrow screen sizes) and ensuring the menu button is consistently visible across all pages.

## Problem Solved
Previously, on mobile devices, the navigation menu was:
- Hidden by default, requiring users to click a hamburger menu button to reveal it
- Taking up the full width of the screen when open
- Automatically closing on navigation to a new page
- Lacking accessibility features and proper visual separation
- The hamburger menu button was not consistently visible on all pages, particularly on the "All Agents" page

## Solution Implemented
The enhanced mobile navigation now includes:

1. **Improved Visual Design**
   - Semi-transparent overlay that separates the sidebar from content
   - Fixed width sidebar (80% of screen width with a maximum width)
   - Shadow to provide depth and separation

2. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Close button within the sidebar for easier dismissal
   - Keyboard support (ESC key closes the sidebar)
   - Smoother transitions with better timing
   - Consistently visible menu button on all pages with improved z-index

3. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Proper ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-expanded, aria-controls)
   - Better keyboard navigation support
   - Improved focus management
   - Menu button always accessible regardless of page content

## Usage
The mobile navigation behavior is automatic based on screen size:
- On wider screens (≥640px): Navigation sidebar is always visible
- On mobile (<640px): Navigation is hidden behind a hamburger menu button
  - Click the menu button to open the sidebar
  - Click the close button (X), the overlay, or press ESC to close
  - The menu button remains visible and accessible on all pages

## Technical Implementation
The implementation involved modifying `components/nav.tsx` to:
1. Add a semi-transparent overlay behind the sidebar
2. Enhance the sidebar styling to use a fixed width with max-width
3. Add a close button in the top-right corner of the sidebar
4. Add ARIA attributes for accessibility
5. Add keyboard event handler for ESC key
6. Improve transitions for smoother animation
7. Increase z-index of the menu button from z-20 to z-50 to ensure visibility
8. Ensure proper positioning of the menu button for consistent accessibility

## Testing
The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/components/nav.unit.test.tsx` that verify:
- Sidebar toggle functionality
- Overlay appearance and interaction
- Close button functionality
- Accessibility attributes
- Menu button visibility on all pages
- Proper z-index and positioning of the menu button

## Future Improvements
Potential future enhancements could include:
- Remembering the open/closed state between page loads
- Animating the hamburger menu icon to transform into an X
- Adding swipe gestures for touch devices 
- Menu button visibility on all pages
- Proper z-index and positioning of the menu button

- Animating the hamburger menu icon to transform into an X
- Adding swipe gestures for touch devices
