# Mobile Navigation Menu Enhancement

## Overview
This feature enhances the mobile navigation experience by improving the sidebar behavior, adding an overlay, and improving accessibility.

## Problem Statement
Currently, on mobile devices (or narrow window sizes), the navigation menu disappears entirely, and users must click a hamburger menu button to reveal it. Additionally, when navigating between pages, the sidebar automatically closes, requiring users to re-open it on each page. This creates a suboptimal user experience on mobile devices.

Furthermore, the hamburger menu button is not consistently visible on all pages, particularly on the "All Agents" page, making it difficult for users to access navigation on certain screens.

## Solution Design
Enhance the mobile navigation with the following improvements:

1. Add a semi-transparent overlay behind the sidebar when opened on mobile
2. Make the sidebar take up less space on mobile screens (currently full width)
3. Add a close button inside the sidebar for better UX
4. Improve accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
5. Add smooth transitions for all interactive elements
6. Fix visibility issues with the menu button across all pages
7. Ensure proper z-index and positioning so the menu button is always accessible

## Files to Modify

### 1. `components/nav.tsx`
- Update the sidebar toggle button with ARIA attributes
- Add an overlay component that appears when the sidebar is open
- Modify sidebar styling for mobile devices
- Add a close button within the sidebar
- Enhance transitions for a smoother experience
- Fix z-index and positioning of the menu button to ensure visibility on all pages

## Technical Implementation Details

### Sidebar Toggle Button
- Add `aria-label` and `aria-expanded` attributes
- Ensure proper focus management when opening/closing
- Increase z-index from z-20 to z-50 to ensure visibility over other elements
- Use fixed positioning to ensure the button remains accessible on all pages

### Overlay
- Add a semi-transparent dark overlay behind the sidebar
- Make it clickable to close the sidebar
- Include proper transition effects

### Sidebar Styling
- Change from full-width to a more appropriate width (80% of screen)
- Ensure content is accessible and properly sized
- Add elevation/shadow to distinguish from background

### Close Button
- Add a close button within the sidebar for easier dismissal
- Position appropriately for easy access

### Accessibility
- Add keyboard navigation support
- Ensure proper screen reader support
- Manage focus correctly when opening/closing the sidebar

## Testing Strategy
The implementation will be tested using the following approach:

1. Unit tests to verify:
   - Menu button visibility on mobile
   - Menu button z-index and positioning on all pages, especially "All Agents"
   - Sidebar toggle functionality
   - Overlay visibility and functionality
   - Close button functionality
   - Accessibility attributes

2. Manual testing to verify:
   - Responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Touch interactions
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Menu button visibility across all application routes

## Acceptance Criteria
- Menu button appears on mobile devices and is accessible on ALL pages of the application
- Menu button has proper z-index to appear above other page elements
- Clicking the menu button shows the sidebar with proper animation
- An overlay appears behind the sidebar when open
- Clicking the overlay closes the sidebar
- A close button is available within the sidebar
- The sidebar has appropriate width on mobile (not full width)
- All elements have smooth transitions
- Navigation is fully accessible via keyboard and screen readers
- No regression in desktop navigation functionality
