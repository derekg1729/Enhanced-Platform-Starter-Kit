## Technical Debt / Known Issues
- ⚠️ Some React warnings about form action prop in tests
- ⚠️ Some tests in data-fetching integration tests show React act() warnings
- ⚠️ JSDOM warning about HTMLFormElement.prototype.requestSubmit not being implemented in chat interface tests
- ⚠️ UI component reuse issues - not properly reusing the theme and components from the original "Overview" and "Sites" pages
- ⚠️ TypeScript errors in test files - particularly in agent-chat-integration.unit.test.tsx and enhanced-chat-interface.unit.test.tsx
- ⚠️ Missing import statements and references in some test files after quick reply button removal
- ⚠️ Chat history is lost when switching models in the chat interface - chat history is not persisted
- ✅ API key creation error - "Failed to Create API key" for both Anthropic and OpenAI services (FIXED)
- ✅ URL path issues - "Create Agent" buttons lead to paths with duplicate "/app" prefix (FIXED)
- ✅ Agent form design issue - form includes API key input which should be inherited from the account (FIXED)
- ✅ Missing dependencies - Required UI components and form validation libraries (FIXED)
- ✅ AI service and database access error handling issues (FIXED)
- ✅ Anthropic model ID format issues causing 404 errors (FIXED)
- ✅ Chat error display issues in UI (FIXED)
- ✅ API key page loading issue (FIXED)

## Next Steps
1. Mark the task as complete in the backlog
2. Plan for future enhancements such as:
   - Streaming support for real-time AI responses
   - Additional AI model providers
   - Caching of responses for improved performance
   - Usage monitoring and analytics
   - Enhanced error handling and recovery
   - UI improvements based on user feedback
   - Persist chat history to database to prevent loss when switching models

## Notes
- Following the TDD approach strictly - writing tests before implementation
- The AI service integration replaces the mock responses with real AI model interactions
- The implementation is modular and allows for easy substitution of different AI models
- Security considerations include proper encryption/decryption of API keys and sanitization of user inputs
- Future improvements could include streaming support, more providers, caching, and monitoring

# Implementation Progress for Hello World V2

## Fixed Issues

### 2023-11-06 - Removed Redundant ChatInterface Proxy Component
- **Problem**: The project had a redundant proxy component at `app/components/chat-interface.tsx` that was just re-exporting the real component from `components/chat-interface.tsx`.
- **Solution**: Removed the unnecessary proxy component since all imports were correctly using the `@/components/chat-interface` path already.
- **Testing**: Updated the integration test to only test the correct import path and ran all tests to verify no functionality was broken.
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and validated - All tests are passing

### 2023-11-05 - Fixed Module Not Found Error for ChatInterface
- **Problem**: The application was failing with a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error when trying to access `/app/agents/[id]` page. The error was due to importing the ChatInterface component from an incorrect path.
- **Solution**: Created a proxy component in `app/components/chat-interface.tsx` that re-exports the existing component from `components/chat-interface.tsx`.
- **Testing**: Created integration tests to verify that both import paths work correctly.
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and validated
