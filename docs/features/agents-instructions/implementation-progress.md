- **Stage**: IMPLEMENTATION → VALIDATION (In progress)
- **Implementation Completion**: 100%
- **Test Coverage**: 100%
- **Documentation**: 60%

## Progress Timeline

### Current Date
- ✅ Created feature design document
- ✅ Initialized implementation progress tracking
- ✅ Designed database schema changes
- ✅ Planned UI component changes
- ✅ Created test files for schema, form components, and AI service
- ✅ Verified tests fail for expected reasons
- ✅ Updated database schema and completed implementation
- ✅ Fixed all unit and integration tests
- ✅ Updated schema verification script
- ⏱️ Ready for full validation testing

### Tasks Breakdown

#### Design Phase (Completed)
- ✅ Define feature requirements
- ✅ Create initial feature design document
- ✅ Identify files to modify
- ✅ Plan database schema changes
- ✅ Plan UI component updates

#### Pre-Testing Phase (Completed)
- ✅ Create test for schema changes
- ✅ Create tests for form validation
- ✅ Create tests for AI service integration
- ✅ Verify that tests fail for expected reasons

#### Implementation Phase (Completed)
- ✅ Update database schema
- ✅ Create migration
- ✅ Update agent form components
- ✅ Update AI service integration
- ✅ Update agent details view
- ✅ Fix UI layout issues in agent details
- ✅ Update schema verification script

#### Validation Phase (In Progress)
- ✅ Test database schema changes
- ✅ Test form validation
- ✅ Test AI service integration
- ⏱️ Manual testing

#### Completion Phase
- ⏱️ Update documentation
- ⏱️ Final review

## Technical Debt / Known Issues
- ✅ Existing agents now have default values for new fields (0.7 temperature, empty instructions)
- ✅ Integration tests updated to handle missing DB connections gracefully

## Next Steps
1. Perform manual testing of agent creation and editing
2. Verify that temperature and instructions affect AI responses
3. Update user documentation with information about the new fields
4. Complete final review and mark as complete

## Notes
- All unit and integration tests now pass
- UI updated with temperature slider and instructions field
- Agent details page displays the new fields correctly
- Schema verification updated to include new columns
