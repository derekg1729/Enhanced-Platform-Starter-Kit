# Implementation Progress for DYNAMIC-AGENT-SELECTION

## Summary
This document tracks the implementation progress of the Dynamic Agent Selection feature, which will replace hardcoded model lists with dynamic API-based model discovery.

## Current Status
- **Workflow**: TDD
- **Stage**: IMPLEMENTATION ➡️ VALIDATION
- **Implementation Completion**: 90%
- **Test Coverage**: 50%
- **Documentation**: 30%

## Progress Timeline

### July 17, 2024
- ✅ Created feature design document
- ✅ Initialized implementation progress tracking
- ✅ Identified files to modify and create
- ✅ Designed provider-based architecture
- ✅ Created test files for model providers
- ✅ Verified tests fail for expected reasons (implementations missing)

### July 19, 2024
- ✅ Implemented model provider interfaces and types
- ✅ Created model registry
- ✅ Implemented OpenAI and Anthropic providers 
- ✅ Created server actions for fetching models
- ✅ Created API routes for model discovery
- ✅ Updated UI components for dynamic model selection
- ✅ Integrated with AI service
- ✅ Implemented fallback for when API calls fail

## Tasks Breakdown

### Design Phase (Complete)
- ✅ Define feature requirements
- ✅ Create initial feature design document
- ✅ Design provider-based architecture
- ✅ Identify files to create/modify
- ✅ Define test strategy for each component
- ✅ Define interface contracts between components
- ✅ Identify potential edge cases and error scenarios

### Pre-Testing Phase (Complete)
- ✅ Create test files for model provider interfaces
- ✅ Create tests for OpenAI provider implementation
- ✅ Create tests for Anthropic provider implementation
- ✅ Create tests for model registry
- ✅ Create tests for UI components with dynamic models
- ✅ Verify that tests fail for expected reasons

### Implementation Phase (Complete)
- ✅ Implement model provider interfaces and types
- ✅ Implement model registry
- ✅ Implement OpenAI provider
- ✅ Implement Anthropic provider
- ✅ Implement server actions for fetching models
- ✅ Create API routes for model discovery
- ✅ Update UI components for dynamic model selection
- ✅ Integrate with AI service
- ✅ Add fallbacks for handling API failures

### Validation Phase (In Progress)
- ⏳ Run all tests
- ⏳ Fix any failing tests
- ⏳ Test with real API connections
- ⏳ Test UI behavior with dynamic models
- ⏳ Test error scenarios and fallbacks

### Completion Phase (Not Started)
- ⏳ Update documentation
- ⏳ Final review
- ⏳ Ensure all tests pass
- ⏳ Create pull request

## Technical Debt / Known Issues
- ✅ Fixed: Previous implementation used hardcoded model IDs that may be outdated
- ✅ Fixed: Claude models had a workaround using opus as fallback for sonnet
- ⏳ Need to show model capabilities to users in the UI
- ⏳ Add refresh capability for model lists when API keys change

## Next Steps
1. Run all tests to ensure the implementation works as expected
2. Test with real API connections to verify model discovery
3. Fix any issues found during validation
4. Update documentation with the new model discovery process
5. Create pull request for review

## Notes
- Implementation follows the TDD approach with all tests created first
- UI components now fetch models dynamically from the API
- Fallback mechanisms are in place for when API calls fail
- Model registry pattern allows for easy addition of new providers in the future
