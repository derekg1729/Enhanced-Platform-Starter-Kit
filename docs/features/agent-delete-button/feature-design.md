## Overview

This feature adds a delete button to the agent edit page, allowing users to easily delete agents they no longer need. The delete functionality will be implemented with proper confirmation to prevent accidental deletions.

## Technical Design

### Component Changes

| Component | Changes Needed |
|-----------|---------------|
| Edit Agent Page | Add delete button with confirmation dialog |
| Action Implementation | Create or modify action to handle agent deletion |

### Files to Modify

### UI/UX Design

#### Delete Button
- Position at the bottom of the form, separate from the save button
- Use red color to indicate destructive action
- Include confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion

#### Confirmation Dialog
- Clear warning message about permanent deletion
- Require explicit confirmation
- Provide cancel option
- Display agent name in confirmation message

### Implementation Strategy

1. Add delete button to the edit form component
2. Implement confirmation dialog
3. Add or update server action for agent deletion
4. Add proper error handling and success notifications
5. Add redirection to agents list after successful deletion

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test delete button rendering
- Test confirmation dialog functionality

- Test error handling

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Changes are contained to existing agent edit functionality
