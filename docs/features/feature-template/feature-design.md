# [FEATURE_KEY] - Feature Design

## Overview

Brief description of the feature, its goals, and how it fits into the larger system architecture.

## Technical Design

### Components

| Component | Description | Reuse Strategy |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Component 1 | Purpose and functionality | New/Modified/Reused |
| Component 2 | Purpose and functionality | New/Modified/Reused |
| Component 3 | Purpose and functionality | New/Modified/Reused |

### Database Schema Changes

```typescript
// New or modified schema definitions go here
```

### API Routes

| Route | Method | Purpose | Auth Required |
|-------|--------|---------|---------------|
| `/api/[resource]/[action]` | GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | Description | Yes/No |

### State Management

How state is managed within the feature, including:
- Client-side state
- Server-side state
- Persistence strategy

### Security Considerations

- Authentication requirements
- Authorization strategy
- Data validation
- Any potential security concerns and mitigation strategies

## Implementation Strategy

### Files to Create

| File Path | Purpose | Dependencies |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `path/to/file.ts` | Brief description | List of dependencies |

### Files to Modify

| File Path | Changes Needed | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| `path/to/file.ts` | Description of changes | Potential impacts on other parts of the system |

### Test Strategy

| Test Type | Files | Coverage Goals |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Unit | `tests/unit/path/to/test.ts` | Components/functions to test |
| Integration | `tests/integration/path/to/test.ts` | Integrations to test |

## User Experience

### User Flow

1. User initiates [action]
2. System responds with [response]
3. User completes [task]
4. System confirms [outcome]

### Error Handling

| Error Scenario | User Experience | Technical Handling |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Error 1 | What the user sees | How the system handles it |
| Error 2 | What the user sees | How the system handles it |
