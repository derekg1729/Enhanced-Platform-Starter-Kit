# Computer Heuristics Improvement Protocol (CHIP) Analyses

This directory contains analyses and improvements made through the CHIP process, which is our systematic approach to improving development processes and rules based on real-world incidents.

## Available Analyses

1. [v2.11 - Environment Consistency Check Issue](./v2.11-env-consistency.md) - Analysis of issues with environment variable consistency checks and proposed solutions.

2. [v2.11 - Pre-Commit Hook Bypass Issue](./v2.11-pre-commit-hooks.md) - Analysis of the issue with bypassing pre-commit hooks and proposed solutions to prevent it.

## CHIP Process Overview

The CHIP process consists of the following stages:

1. **PAUSE** - Pause the current development process when an issue is identified
2. **ANALYSIS** - Analyze the root causes of the issue
3. **IMPLEMENTATION** - Implement improvements to prevent similar issues
4. **RESUME** - Resume the development process with the new improvements in place

Each analysis document follows a standard structure:
- Incident Summary
- Root Cause Analysis
- Proposed Solutions
- Implementation Plan
- Lessons Learned
- Next Steps

## Version History

- **v2.11** - Added error recovery paths for pre-commit hook failures and improved guidance on handling environment consistency issues
