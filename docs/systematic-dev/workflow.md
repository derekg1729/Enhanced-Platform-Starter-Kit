# Systematic Development Workflow

This document explains the systematic development approach used in this project and how to implement it using Cursor rules.

## Core Concept

The systematic development workflow is a structured approach to software development that enables AI-driven automation with minimal human intervention. It uses a set of well-defined steps and documentation to create a self-sustaining development process.

## Workflow Process

The systematic development process follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - AI reads the project description to understand the context
   - AI reviews the development rules to understand constraints
   - AI acknowledges the rules and confirms understanding

2. **Task Selection**:
   - AI checks the backlog for the highest priority task with status "To Do"
   - AI updates the change log to indicate work has started on the task
   - AI updates the task status in the backlog to "In Progress"

3. **Solution Design**:
   - AI reviews the solution design document for context
   - AI designs a solution for the current task
   - AI updates the solution design document with the new design

4. **Implementation**:
   - AI implements the solution according to the design
   - AI follows the development rules during implementation
   - AI updates the module registry if new modules are created

5. **Verification**:
   - AI verifies the implementation against the acceptance criteria
   - AI checks for potential bugs or issues
   - AI updates the bug tracker if issues are found

6. **Completion**:
   - AI updates the task status in the backlog to "Done"
   - AI updates the change log with completion details
   - AI returns to step 2 to select the next task

## Cursor Rules Implementation

The workflow is implemented using Cursor rules, which provide a structured way to guide the AI through the development process.

### Cursor Rules File Structure

The `.cursorrules` file in the root of the project defines the workflow steps and instructions for the AI. It includes:

- **Systematic Development Workflow**: The main workflow for implementing tasks
- **Bug Resolution Workflow**: A workflow for resolving bugs
- **Documentation Update Workflow**: A workflow for updating documentation

### Main Workflow Steps

The Systematic Development Workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Initialize**: Read project documentation and understand the context
2. **Select Task**: Select the highest priority task from the backlog
3. **Start Task**: Update documentation to reflect task has started
4. **Design Solution**: Design a solution for the selected task
5. **Implement Solution**: Implement the designed solution
6. **Verify Implementation**: Verify the implementation meets the acceptance criteria
7. **Complete Task**: Update documentation to reflect task completion
8. **Repeat Process**: Return to task selection and continue the workflow

### Bug Resolution Workflow

The Bug Resolution Workflow includes steps for:

1. **Select Bug**: Select the highest priority bug from the bug tracker
2. **Start Bug Resolution**: Update documentation to reflect bug resolution has started
3. **Analyze Bug**: Analyze the bug to understand its cause
4. **Design Fix**: Design a fix for the bug
5. **Implement Fix**: Implement the designed fix
6. **Verify Fix**: Verify the fix resolves the bug
7. **Complete Bug Resolution**: Update documentation to reflect bug resolution completion
8. **Return to Development**: Return to the main development workflow

### Documentation Update Workflow

The Documentation Update Workflow includes steps for:

1. **Identify Documentation Needs**: Identify documentation that needs to be updated
2. **Update Documentation**: Update the identified documentation
3. **Verify Documentation**: Verify the documentation is accurate and complete
4. **Record Documentation Update**: Record the documentation update in the change log
5. **Return to Development**: Return to the main development workflow

## Using the Workflow

To use the systematic development workflow:

1. **Create the Core Documents**:
   - Ensure all essential documentation files are in place
   - Use the templates provided in this document as a starting point

2. **Initialize the Workflow**:
   - Start a conversation with Cursor
   - Ask it to begin the systematic development workflow
   - Cursor will follow the steps defined in the rules

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Review the changes to the documentation files
   - Provide feedback and guidance as needed
   - Approve or request changes to implementations

4. **Intervene When Necessary**:
   - While the workflow is designed to be autonomous, you may need to intervene in certain situations
   - Provide additional guidance or clarification if needed
   - Prioritize tasks or bugs if necessary

## GitHub Integration

The workflow can be integrated with GitHub to enhance collaboration and automation:

1. **Repository Setup**:
   - Store documentation files in the `docs/systematic-dev/` directory
   - Add the `.cursorrules` file to the root of the repository

2. **Issue Tracking**:
   - Mirror the backlog as GitHub Issues
   - Use labels for priorities and status
   - Link issues to corresponding tasks in the backlog

3. **Pull Requests**:
   - Create pull requests for completed tasks
   - Include task details and acceptance criteria in the PR description
   - Use PR templates to standardize the format

4. **Automation**:
   - Set up GitHub Actions to validate document structure
   - Create workflows that update the change log based on commits
   - Implement checks for development rules compliance

## Example Prompt

When you're ready to start the workflow, use a prompt like this:

```
Please begin the systematic development workflow for this project. Start by reading the project description and development rules, then work through the tasks in the backlog one by one. Follow the steps defined in the Cursor rules, and keep me updated on your progress.
```

## Customizing the Workflow

You can customize the workflow to suit your specific needs:

1. **Add or Remove Steps**:
   - Modify the steps in the Cursor rules to add or remove steps as needed
   - Adjust the instructions for each step to match your development process

2. **Add New Workflows**:
   - Create additional workflows for specific aspects of your development process
   - Link the workflows together to create a comprehensive development system

3. **Customize Document Templates**:
   - Modify the document templates to include additional information or sections
   - Create new document types if needed for your specific project

4. **Adjust GitHub Integration**:
   - Customize the GitHub integration to match your team's workflow
   - Create custom GitHub Actions to automate specific aspects of your process
