# Project Description: Agent Platform

## Overview
The Agent Platform is a multi-tenant system for creating, deploying, and managing AI agents that perform specific tasks. The platform provides a public-facing interface for discovering and using agents, as well as an authenticated application for creating and managing agents. Each agent is containerized and can connect to third-party tools via APIs.

## Goals
- Create a platform where users can discover and use AI agents
- Enable developers to build and deploy their own agents
- Provide a secure, scalable infrastructure for running agents
- Support integration with third-party tools and services
- Enable monetization of agents by their creators
- Facilitate analytics and monitoring of agent performance

## Architecture
The Agent Platform follows a multi-tenant architecture with the following key components:

1. **Frontend**: Next.js application with public and authenticated areas
2. **Backend**: Next.js API routes and serverless functions
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with row-level security for multi-tenant data isolation
4. **Agent Runtime**: Containerized environments for running agents
5. **Integration Layer**: API connectors for third-party services
6. **Analytics**: Tracking and monitoring of agent performance and usage

The system uses a subdomain-based approach for tenant isolation, with each tenant having their own subdomain (e.g., `tenant1.agentplatform.com`).

## Key Components

### Public Interface
- **Landing Page**: Introduction to the platform and featured agents
- **Agent Directory**: Searchable directory of available agents
- **Agent Details**: Detailed information about each agent, including capabilities and pricing
- **User Registration/Login**: Authentication for accessing the platform

### Authenticated Application
- **Dashboard**: Overview of user's agents and usage statistics
- **Agent Management**: Interface for creating, configuring, and deploying agents
- **Integration Management**: Tools for connecting agents to third-party services
- **Billing and Subscription**: Management of payments and subscriptions

### Agent System
- **Agent Container**: Isolated environment for running agent code
- **Agent Configuration**: Settings and parameters for agent behavior
- **Agent Monitoring**: Tracking of agent performance and resource usage
- **Agent Marketplace**: System for publishing and monetizing agents

### Integration Framework
- **API Connectors**: Pre-built connectors for common services
- **Custom Integrations**: Tools for building custom integrations
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and management of API keys and credentials
- **Webhook Support**: Handling of incoming webhooks from external services

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Vercel Edge Functions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with GitHub OAuth
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics, Langfuse for LLM monitoring
- **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend/backend, custom infrastructure for agent containers

## Constraints
- Must support multiple tenants with complete data isolation
- Must handle sensitive API credentials securely
- Must scale to support thousands of concurrent agent executions
- Must provide detailed analytics for agent performance
- Must support a variety of integration points with third-party services
- Must maintain high availability and reliability
