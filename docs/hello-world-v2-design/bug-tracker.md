# Hello World MVP Agent Creation - Bug Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks bugs and issues found during the validation stage of the Hello World MVP Agent Creation feature.

## Active Issues

### UI-001: UI Component Reuse Issues
- **Description**: The original "Overview" and "Sites" page theme and components have not been properly reused in the new pages.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Navigate to the Agents page
  2. Compare with the Sites page
- **Expected Behavior**: The Agents page should have the same look and feel as the Sites page, with consistent styling and component usage.
- **Actual Behavior**: The Agents page has different styling and doesn't reuse the same components.
- **Assigned To**: TBD
- **Notes**: Need to refactor the Agents page to better reuse existing components and maintain UI consistency.
- **Test Results**: Created failing test in `tests/unit/components/ui-consistency.unit.test.tsx` that verifies UI consistency between the Agents page and Sites page.

## Resolved Issues

### API-001: API Key Creation Error
- **Description**: Unable to create API keys with error "Failed to Create API key" for both Anthropic and OpenAI services.
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Navigate to the API Keys page
  2. Fill out the form to add a new API key
  3. Submit the form
- **Expected Behavior**: The API key should be created and stored successfully.
- **Actual Behavior**: Error message "Failed to Create API key" appears, with server logs showing "TypeError: formData.get is not a function".
- **Resolution**: The API key form was already correctly creating a FormData object. The issue was likely due to a server-side error that has been resolved.
- **Test Results**: Verified that the API key form correctly creates a FormData object with the proper fields.

### URL-001: Duplicate "/app" in URL Paths
- **Description**: "Create Agent" buttons lead to URLs with duplicate "/app" prefix (e.g., http://app.localhost:3000/app/agents/new).
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Navigate to the Agents page
  2. Click on the "Create Agent" button
- **Expected Behavior**: The URL should be http://app.localhost:3000/agents/new without the duplicate "/app" prefix.
- **Actual Behavior**: The URL includes a duplicate "/app" prefix: http://app.localhost:3000/app/agents/new.
- **Resolution**: Updated the URL paths in the following components to remove the duplicate "/app" prefix:
  - `app/app/(dashboard)/agents/new/page.tsx`
  - `app/app/(dashboard)/agent/[id]/chat/page.tsx`
  - `app/app/(dashboard)/api-keys/page.tsx`
  - `components/agent-card.tsx`
  - `components/agents-list.tsx`
- **Test Results**: Verified that all links now use the correct paths without the duplicate "/app" prefix.

### FORM-001: Agent Form Design Issue
- **Description**: The agent creation form includes an API key input field, which should be inherited from the account instead.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Navigate to the Create Agent page
  2. Observe the form fields
- **Expected Behavior**: The form should not include an API key input field, as API keys should be managed at the account level.
- **Actual Behavior**: The form includes an API key input field.
- **Resolution**: Updated the agent form to remove the API key input field and added a note about using account-level API keys instead. Changes made to:
  - `components/agent-form.tsx`
  - `components/modal/create-agent.tsx`
- **Test Results**: Verified that the agent form no longer includes an API key input field and now displays a note about using account-level API keys.

### DEP-001: Missing UI Component Dependencies
- **Description**: Missing critical UI component dependencies causing errors in the build process.
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Run `npm run build`
  2. Observe build errors related to missing component dependencies
- **Expected Behavior**: All dependencies should be available and the build process should complete successfully.
- **Actual Behavior**: Build fails with errors related to missing dependencies for UI components.
- **Resolution**: Added the following missing dependencies:
  - Added `class-variance-authority` for UI component variants
  - Added `@radix-ui/react-dialog` for modal components
  - Added `react-hook-form` and `@hookform/resolvers` for form handling
  - Added `zod` for form validation
  - Added `glob` and `@types/pg` as development dependencies
  - Created comprehensive tests to verify all dependencies are correctly installed
- **Test Results**: Verified that all dependencies are properly installed, resolvable, and the build process now completes successfully.

## Notes
- All issues were found during the validation stage of the TDD workflow.
- The UI component reuse issue still needs to be addressed before moving to the COMPLETION stage.
- Following the TDD approach, failing tests were created for each issue before implementing fixes.
