# Hello World MVP Agent Creation - Feature Progress

## Current Status
- **Workflow**: TDD
- **Stage**: IMPLEMENTATION
- **Feature**: HELLO_WORLD_V2

## Completed
- ‚úÖ Tests for modal components
- ‚úÖ Implementation of modal components
- ‚úÖ Encryption utilities for API key management
  - Created `lib/encryption.ts` with AES-256-GCM encryption
  - Implemented `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions
  - Added `encryptApiKey` and `decryptApiKey` functions
  - Comprehensive tests with 100% coverage
- ‚úÖ Agent configuration form component
  - Created `components/agent-form.tsx`
  - Implemented API key visibility toggle
  - Added model selection dropdown
  - Integrated with encryption utilities
  - Comprehensive tests for the component (all passing)
- ‚úÖ Agent card component for displaying agents
  - Created `components/agent-card.tsx`
  - Displays agent name, description, and model type
  - Provides buttons to chat with the agent or delete it
  - Implemented delete functionality with proper error handling
  - Comprehensive tests for the component (all passing)
- ‚úÖ Tests for agent-related components and pages
  - Created tests for `AgentsList` component
  - Created tests for agents page
  - Created tests for new agent page
  - Created tests for agent chat page
  - Created tests for chat interface component
  - Created tests for useChat hook
  - Created tests for agent-related actions (getAgents, getAgent, deleteAgent, sendMessage)
  - Confirmed all tests are failing as expected (TDD approach)

## In Progress
- üîÑ Implementing components and functionality
  - Working on implementing the components to make tests pass
  - Starting with the agent schema and actions
  - Will then implement UI components and hooks

## Pending
- ‚è≥ VALIDATION stage
- ‚è≥ COMPLETION stage

## Technical Debt / Known Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some React warnings about form action prop in tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some tests in data-fetching integration tests show React act() warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to implement the UI button component for the agents list
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to fix mocking approach for db and auth modules in tests

## Next Steps
1. Implement agent schema in lib/schema.ts
2. Implement agent actions in lib/actions.ts (getAgents, getAgent, deleteAgent, sendMessage)
3. Implement UI components (AgentsList, ChatInterface)
4. Implement hooks (useChat)
5. Implement page components
6. Address React warnings in form components
7. Run all tests to ensure everything is working correctly
8. Move to VALIDATION stage when implementation is complete

## Dependencies
- None currently blocking progress

## Notes
- Following the TDD approach strictly - implementing components to make tests pass
- Focusing on reusing existing components and patterns where possible
- Ensuring proper separation of client and server components
- Using AES-256-GCM encryption for secure API key storage
- Form components use React Server Actions for form submission
