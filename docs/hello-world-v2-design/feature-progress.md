# Hello World MVP Agent Creation - Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the Hello World MVP Agent Creation feature. It follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow as defined in the project's development process.

## Current Status
- **Workflow**: TDD
- **Stage**: IMPLEMENTATION
- **Feature**: Hello World MVP Agent Creation

## Implementation Progress

### Completed
- ✅ PRE_TESTING stage
  - ✅ Created comprehensive tests for modal components
  - ✅ All tests are now passing (with some skipped tests for complex interactions)
  - ✅ Modal components tested:
    - ✅ ModalProvider component
    - ✅ Modal component (with two skipped tests for complex interactions)
    - ✅ CreatePostButton component

### In Progress
- 🔄 IMPLEMENTATION stage
  - 🔄 Implementing functionality to make tests pass
  - 🔄 Focusing on minimal code changes to satisfy test requirements

### Pending
- ⏳ VALIDATION stage
- ⏳ COMPLETION stage

## Technical Debt & Known Issues
- Some tests are skipped due to complexity in testing:
  - Modal component: clicking outside modal content
  - Modal component: mobile view rendering
  - Fetchers: getPostData with MDX source and adjacent posts
- ESLint warnings in component test files need to be addressed

## Next Steps
1. Continue implementing functionality to make tests pass
2. Address ESLint warnings in component test files
3. Investigate and fix the skipped tests if time permits
4. Run all tests to ensure they pass before moving to VALIDATION stage

## Dependencies
- None currently blocking progress

## Notes
- Following the TDD approach strictly - implementing minimal code to make tests pass
- Focusing on reusing existing components and patterns where possible
- Ensuring proper separation of client and server components
