# Hello World MVP Agent Creation - Feature Progress

## Current Status
- **Workflow**: TDD
- **Stage**: IMPLEMENTATION
- **Feature**: HELLO_WORLD_V2

## Completed
- ‚úÖ Tests for modal components
- ‚úÖ Implementation of modal components
- ‚úÖ Encryption utilities for API key management
  - Created `lib/encryption.ts` with AES-256-GCM encryption
  - Implemented `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions
  - Added `encryptApiKey` and `decryptApiKey` functions
  - Comprehensive tests with 100% coverage
- ‚úÖ Agent configuration form component
  - Created `components/agent-form.tsx`
  - Implemented API key visibility toggle
  - Added model selection dropdown
  - Integrated with encryption utilities
  - Comprehensive tests for the component (all passing)
- ‚úÖ Agent card component for displaying agents
  - Created `components/agent-card.tsx`
  - Displays agent name, description, and model type
  - Provides buttons to chat with the agent or delete it
  - Implemented delete functionality with proper error handling
  - Comprehensive tests for the component (all passing)
- ‚úÖ Tests for agent-related components and pages
  - Created tests for `AgentsList` component
  - Created tests for agents page
  - Created tests for new agent page
  - Created tests for agent chat page
  - Created tests for chat interface component
  - Created tests for useChat hook
  - Created tests for agent-related actions (getAgents, getAgent, deleteAgent, sendMessage)
  - Confirmed all tests are failing as expected (TDD approach)
- ‚úÖ Implementation of useChat hook
  - Created `hooks/use-chat.ts` with chat state management
  - Implemented message sending functionality
  - Added loading state management
  - Fixed and improved tests to properly handle async state updates
  - All tests now passing
- ‚úÖ Fixed mocking approach for unit tests
  - Updated mocking approach for database and auth modules
  - Fixed test expectations to match actual implementation
  - All tests now passing
- ‚úÖ Tests for API connections and components
  - Created tests for API connection actions (createApiConnection, getApiConnections, deleteApiConnection)
  - Created tests for API key form component
  - Created tests for API connections list component
  - Created tests for API keys page
  - Verified tests are failing as expected (TDD approach)
- ‚úÖ Implemented API connections schema and management
  - Added `apiConnections` table to store encrypted API keys
  - Implemented API connection actions (create, get, delete)
  - Created API key form component for adding new API keys
  - Created API connections list component for managing keys
  - Added API keys management page
  - Updated agents page with link to API keys page

## In Progress
- üîÑ Implementing components and functionality
  - Working on implementing the remaining components to make tests pass
  - Focusing on agent schema and actions
  - Will then implement UI components

## Pending
- ‚è≥ VALIDATION stage
- ‚è≥ COMPLETION stage

## Technical Debt / Known Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some React warnings about form action prop in tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some tests in data-fetching integration tests show React act() warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to implement the UI button component for the agents list

## Next Steps
1. Complete the implementation of the chat interface
2. Implement the agent creation page
3. Implement the agent chat page
4. Run all tests to ensure everything is working correctly
5. Move to VALIDATION stage when implementation is complete

## Dependencies
- None currently blocking progress

## Notes
- Following the TDD approach strictly - implementing components to make tests pass
- Focusing on reusing existing components and patterns where possible
- Ensuring proper separation of client and server components
- Using AES-256-GCM encryption for secure API key storage
- Form components use React Server Actions for form submission
