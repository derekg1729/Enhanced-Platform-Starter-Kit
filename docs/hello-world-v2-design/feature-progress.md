# Hello World MVP Agent Creation - Feature Progress

## Current Status
- **Workflow**: TDD
- **Stage**: IMPLEMENTATION
- **Feature**: Hello World MVP Agent Creation

## Completed
- ‚úÖ Tests for modal components
- ‚úÖ Implementation of modal components
- ‚úÖ Encryption utilities for API key management
  - Created `lib/encryption.ts` with AES-256-GCM encryption
  - Implemented `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions
  - Added `encryptApiKey` and `decryptApiKey` functions
  - Comprehensive tests with 100% coverage
- ‚úÖ Agent configuration form component
  - Created `components/agent-form.tsx`
  - Implemented API key visibility toggle
  - Added model selection dropdown
  - Integrated with encryption utilities
  - Comprehensive tests for the component (all passing)
- ‚úÖ Agent card component for displaying agents
  - Created `components/agent-card.tsx`
  - Displays agent name, description, and model type
  - Provides buttons to chat with the agent or delete it
  - Implemented delete functionality with proper error handling
  - Comprehensive tests for the component (all passing)

## In Progress
- üîÑ Agent listing page

## Pending
- ‚è≥ VALIDATION stage
- ‚è≥ COMPLETION stage

## Technical Debt / Known Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some React warnings about form action prop in tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some tests in data-fetching integration tests show React act() warnings

## Next Steps
1. Continue implementing functionality to make tests pass
2. Address React warnings in form components
3. Implement agent listing page
4. Run all tests to ensure everything is working correctly
5. Move to VALIDATION stage when implementation is complete

## Dependencies
- None currently blocking progress

## Notes
- Following the TDD approach strictly - implementing minimal code to make tests pass
- Focusing on reusing existing components and patterns where possible
- Ensuring proper separation of client and server components
- Using AES-256-GCM encryption for secure API key storage
- Form components use React Server Actions for form submission
