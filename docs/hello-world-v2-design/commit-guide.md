# Hello World V2 Design Commit Guide

## Current Issue

We're trying to commit the Hello World V2 design files, but the pre-commit hook is failing due to environment consistency check issues:

```
❌ Missing required variables in .env.local: API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY
❌ Inconsistent NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN values:
   - .env.local: localhost:3000
   - .env.preview: dereks-projects-32c37a6a.vercel.app
   - .env.production: wackywavelength.fyi
❌ Environment consistency check failed. Fix the issues before committing.
```

## Proper Solution (Following the Updated CursorRules)

Since we're only committing documentation files for the Hello World V2 design, we should follow the documentation-only commit process:

1. Create a separate branch for the documentation changes:

```bash
git checkout -b docs/hello-world-v2-design
```

2. Stage only the documentation files:

```bash
git add docs/systematic-dev/hello-world-v2-design.md docs/systematic-dev/workflow-state.md docs/systematic-dev/change-log.md docs/systematic-dev/backlog.md docs/systematic-dev/chip/
```

3. Commit with a clear message indicating it's a documentation change:

```bash
git commit -m "docs: Hello World V2 design documentation and CHIP analyses"
```

4. Push the branch and create a pull request:

```bash
git push -u origin docs/hello-world-v2-design
```

5. In parallel, fix the environment issues on the main development branch:

   - Generate an API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY by running:
     ```bash
     node scripts/generate-encryption-key.js
     ```
   - Add the generated key to your `.env.local` file

## Next Steps

1. After committing the documentation changes, we should update the workflow state to reflect that we're ready to start working on the first task (HW2-1).

2. We should then proceed with the Test-Driven Development workflow, starting with writing tests for the database schema for agents and messages.

3. Remember to follow the TDD workflow for all implementation tasks:
   - Write tests first
   - Verify tests fail
   - Implement the feature
   - Verify tests pass
   - Refactor if needed
