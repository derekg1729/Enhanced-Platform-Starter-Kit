# Hello World MVP Agent Creation - Design Overview

## Feature Summary
A simplified MVP implementation for creating and interacting with AI agents, focusing on:
1. Securely storing API keys for OpenAI and Anthropic
2. Creating agents with a single template
3. Selecting AI models (OpenAI vs Anthropic)
4. Interactive chat with the agent
5. Basic agent management (viewing and deleting)

## Design Principles
- **Pattern Reuse**: Apply successful patterns from the sites implementation while creating agent-specific components
- **Simplicity**: Focus on core functionality without unnecessary complexity
- **Security**: Ensure API keys are properly encrypted and stored using industry-standard encryption
- **Testability**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all components
- **Proper Separation**: Maintain clear client/server component boundaries following Next.js best practices

## Component Strategy
The implementation will create new agent-specific components that follow established patterns:

### Patterns to Reuse
- **Card layout patterns**: Inform AgentCard design but with agent-specific fields and actions
- **Dashboard layout patterns**: Inform agent listing page but with agent-specific data
- **Form patterns**: Inform agent creation forms but with agent-specific fields and validation
- **Empty/loading states**: Direct reuse where appropriate
- **Error handling patterns**: Direct reuse with agent-specific error messages

### New Components Needed
- **AgentCard**: New component inspired by SiteCard but designed for agent data
- **AgentCreationForm**: New component with agent-specific fields and validation
- **ApiKeyForm**: New component for secure API key handling with proper encryption
- **ChatInterface**: New component designed specifically for agent interactions with streaming support
- **ModelSelector**: New component for selecting AI models based on available API connections

## Architecture

### Data Model
- **Agent**: Core entity representing an AI agent
  - Name, description, system prompt, model, temperature
  - Associated with a user (following existing user relation patterns)
- **API Connection**: Stores encrypted API keys for AI services
  - Service type (OpenAI, Anthropic)
  - Encrypted API key (using AES-256-GCM encryption)
  - Associated with a user (following existing user relation patterns)
- **Agent Message**: Stores conversation history
  - Content, role (user/assistant), timestamp
  - Associated with an agent and conversation
  - Designed for efficient retrieval of conversation context

### Component Structure
- **Agent Dashboard (Server Component)**: Lists user's agents
  - AgentList (Client Component): Handles interactive elements
- **Agent Creation (Server Component)**: Provides form container
  - AgentCreationForm (Client Component): Handles form state and submission
- **API Key Management (Server Component)**: Provides secure container
  - ApiKeyForm (Client Component): Handles secure input and submission
- **Chat Interface (Server Component)**: Provides chat container
  - ChatMessages (Client Component): Displays message history
  - ChatInput (Client Component): Handles message input and submission

### API Routes
- **/api/agents**: CRUD operations for agents
- **/api/api-connections**: Secure CRUD operations for API connections
- **/api/agents/[id]/chat**: Streaming chat functionality with the agent

## User Flow
1. User adds API keys for OpenAI and/or Anthropic
2. User creates a new agent with a name, description, and model selection
3. User interacts with the agent through the chat interface
4. User can view and delete agents from the dashboard

## Security Considerations
- API keys are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption
- Encryption key is stored as an environment variable, not in the codebase
- Encryption/decryption happens server-side only, never in the client
- All routes are protected with authentication
- Multi-tenant isolation ensures users can only access their own agents and API keys
- Row-level security in database follows existing patterns

## Performance Considerations
- Minimize client-side state to improve performance
- Proper server/client component separation following Next.js best practices
- Implement streaming responses for chat functionality
- Efficient conversation context management
- Implement proper loading states for async operations

## Testing Strategy
- Develop agent-specific test patterns rather than adapting existing tests
- Create mocks for AI service responses
- Test encryption/decryption of API keys
- Test streaming response handling
- Ensure proper access control in multi-tenant scenarios
- Test error handling for AI service failures
