# Systematic Development Templates

This directory contains template files for the systematic development workflow. These templates are meant to be used as starting points for creating new documentation files.

## Available Templates

- **backlog.md**: Template for tracking tasks and features to be implemented
- **bug-tracker.md**: Template for tracking bugs and their resolution
- **feature-design.md**: Template for documenting feature designs and architecture

## How to Use

1. Copy the appropriate template to the `docs/systematic-dev` directory
2. Rename the file if necessary
3. Fill in the template with the relevant information
4. Commit the changes

## Template Structure

Each template follows a consistent structure with sections and subsections. The templates are designed to be comprehensive but can be modified to suit the specific needs of the project.

## Maintenance

These templates should be updated as the project evolves and new documentation needs arise. If you find that a template is missing important sections or contains unnecessary ones, please update it and document the changes.
