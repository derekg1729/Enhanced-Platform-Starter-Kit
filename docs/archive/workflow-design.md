# Systematic Automated Development Workflow

This document outlines the design for implementing systematic automated development within our agent platform project. The goal is to establish a clear, repeatable workflow that enables AI-driven development with minimal human intervention.

## Core Principles

1. **Multi-Step Development Process**: Development follows a clear sequence of steps from design to implementation to testing.
2. **Autonomous Execution**: The workflow should be capable of running without human intervention.
3. **Systematic Design**: All design decisions should follow established patterns and principles.
4. **Traceability**: Every development artifact should be traceable to its requirements and design decisions.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: The workflow should incorporate feedback loops for self-improvement.

## Workflow Overview

The systematic development workflow consists of the following phases:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐

       │                                                            │
       └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            5. Iterate & Improve
```

## Detailed Phase Descriptions

### 1. Design Phase

## Implementation Approaches

### Option 1: Pure Cursor-Based Implementation

**Description**: Implement the workflow entirely within Cursor using `.cursorrules` and documentation.

**Pros**:
- Simpler implementation
- No external dependencies
- Easier to maintain

**Cons**:
- Limited automation capabilities
- Requires human triggering of each step
- Limited state management
- No autonomous execution

**Implementation Details**:
- Define workflow in `.cursorrules`
- Create templates for each phase
- Establish conventions for artifacts
- Define transition criteria between phases

### Option 2: OpenHands Integration

**Description**: Use OpenHands to orchestrate the workflow, with Cursor handling the implementation details.

**Pros**:
- Full automation capabilities
- Autonomous execution
- Robust state management
- Integration with external systems

**Cons**:
- Additional dependency
- More complex setup
- Potential synchronization issues

**Implementation Details**:
- Install and configure OpenHands
- Define agents and workflows in OpenHands
- Create bridge between OpenHands and Cursor
- Establish state management and persistence

### Option 3: Custom Orchestration System

**Description**: Build a custom orchestration system that integrates with Cursor.

**Pros**:
- Tailored to our specific needs
- Full control over implementation
- Can evolve with our requirements

**Cons**:
- Significant development effort
- Maintenance burden
- Potential reinvention of existing solutions

**Implementation Details**:
- Design orchestration system
- Implement state management
- Create integration with Cursor
- Establish automation triggers

## Recommended Approach

Based on the analysis, **Option 2: OpenHands Integration** appears to be the most promising approach. It provides the automation capabilities we need while leveraging an existing solution designed for this purpose.

The implementation would involve:

1. Setting up OpenHands to orchestrate the workflow
2. Defining the workflow stages in OpenHands
3. Creating templates and patterns in our repository
4. Establishing integration points between OpenHands and our repository
5. Configuring autonomous execution

## Next Steps

1. **Explore OpenHands**: Investigate OpenHands capabilities and integration options
2. **Define Workflow Details**: Elaborate on each phase of the workflow
3. **Create Templates**: Develop templates for each artifact type
4. **Establish Conventions**: Define naming conventions, directory structures, etc.
5. **Prototype Integration**: Create a proof-of-concept integration with OpenHands

## Future Enhancements

Once the basic workflow is established, we can consider the following enhancements:

1. **Metrics and Analytics**: Track development metrics and analyze trends
2. **Quality Gates**: Establish automated quality checks between phases
3. **Learning System**: Implement a system that learns from past development cycles
4. **Integration with CI/CD**: Connect the workflow to our CI/CD pipeline
5. **Customizable Workflows**: Allow for customization of the workflow for different types of development
