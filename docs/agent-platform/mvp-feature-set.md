## Out of Scope for MVP

The following features are explicitly out of scope for the MVP:

1. **Advanced Agent Configuration**
   - Complex parameter tuning
   - Custom model training
   - Fine-grained control over model behavior

2. **Third-party Tool Integration**
   - Connections to external APIs (beyond OpenAI)
   - Data retrieval from external sources
   - Action execution in external systems

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Detailed performance metrics
   - Cost optimization recommendations
   - Advanced usage patterns

4. **Agent Marketplace**
   - Publishing agents for others to use
   - Monetization features
   - Rating and review system

5. **Advanced Containerization**
   - Custom runtime environments
   - Resource allocation controls
   - Scaling policies

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- React components for agent creation and chat interface
- State management for conversation history
- Real-time updates for message delivery
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Backend
- API routes for agent CRUD operations
- Secure handling of OpenAI API keys
- Database schema for agents and messages
- Authentication and authorization middleware

### Database
- Tables for agents, messages, and feedback
- Row-level security policies
- Efficient queries for conversation history
- Proper indexing for performance

### Deployment
- Environment configuration for development and production
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Monitoring for errors and performance issues
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Features | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| 1     | Agent Creation/Management, Multi-tenant Isolation | 1 week | Not Started |
| 2     | Conversational Interface, OpenAI Integration | 1 week | Not Started |
| 3     | Basic Prompt Engineering, Feedback Collection | 1 week | Not Started |
| 4     | Basic Analytics, Testing & Refinement | 1 week | Not Started |

## Success Metrics

The MVP will be considered successful if:

1. Users can create and interact with agents without errors
2. Agents provide helpful responses to basic queries
3. User feedback is predominantly positive
4. The system maintains proper multi-tenant isolation
5. Performance meets acceptable standards (response time < 2s)
6. The platform demonstrates scalability potential

## Next Steps After MVP
