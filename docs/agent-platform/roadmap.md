# Agent Platform Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Agent Platform, a system for creating, managing, and deploying AI agents that can perform specific tasks and connect to third-party tools via APIs.

## Overview

The Agent Platform builds on our existing multi-tenant infrastructure to create a powerful system for AI agent management. The platform will support:

- Creating and configuring AI agents
- Connecting agents to third-party tools via APIs
- Containerizing and scaling agents independently
- Orchestrating multiple agents to work together
- Marketplace for sharing and monetizing agents
- Analytics and monitoring for agent performance

## Current Focus: Hello World Agent

Our immediate focus is on creating a "Hello World" agent to demonstrate the core functionality of the platform. This will involve:

1. Defining the basic agent data model
2. Creating a simple UI for interacting with the agent
3. Implementing a basic execution engine
4. Connecting to an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI)
5. Handling basic conversation flow

This minimal implementation will serve as a foundation for the more advanced features planned in later phases.
