# Agent Platform

A platform for creating, managing, and deploying AI agents that can perform specific tasks and connect to third-party tools via APIs.

## Overview

The Agent Platform is built on top of the Platform Starter Kit, a multi-tenant application framework with custom domain support. It extends the platform with capabilities for AI agents, including:

- Creating and configuring AI agents with specific tasks
- Containerizing agents for isolation and scalability
- Connecting agents to third-party tools via APIs
- Collecting comprehensive analytics and feedback
- Orchestrating multiple agents to work together
- Marketplace for sharing and monetizing agents

## Core Principles

### 1. Containerization

Each agent runs in its own isolated container:

- Secure execution environment
- Independent scaling
- Resource isolation
- Consistent deployment across environments

### 2. Multi-Tenant Isolation

Complete isolation between tenants:

- Data isolation through row-level security
- Separate agent instances per user
- Independent resource allocation
- Secure API key management

### 3. Specific Task Focus

Agents are designed for specific tasks:

- Single responsibility principle
- Clear input/output contracts
- Focused prompt engineering
- Explicit capability boundaries

### 4. Analytics and Feedback Loops

Comprehensive analytics for continuous improvement:

- Usage metrics tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Cost analysis
- User feedback collection
- A/B testing for prompt optimization

- [Architecture](./architecture.md): The high-level architecture of the Agent Platform
- [Hello World Agent](./hello-world-agent.md): Design document for the "Hello World" agent

## Getting Started

To get started with the Agent Platform, follow these steps:

1. Set up the Platform Starter Kit as described in the main README
2. Create a "Hello World" agent using the Agent Platform
3. Explore the agent's capabilities and customize it for your needs

## Hello World Agent

The "Hello World" agent is a simple conversational agent that can respond to basic queries. It demonstrates the core functionality of the Agent Platform, including:

- Agent data model
- Basic UI for interaction
- Integration with LLM API
- Simple conversation flow
- Containerization foundation
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Analytics and feedback collection

To create a "Hello World" agent:

1. Navigate to the Agent Dashboard
2. Click "Create Agent"
3. Configure the agent with a name, description, and prompt
4. Configure containerization settings (optional)
5. Save the agent
6. Start a conversation with the agent
7. Provide feedback on agent responses

## Development

The Agent Platform is under active development. The current focus is on implementing the "Hello World" agent as a foundation for more advanced features.

### Current Status

- [x] Project planning and architecture design
- [ ] Agent data model and schema
- [ ] Containerization foundation
- [ ] Basic agent UI
- [ ] OpenAI integration
- [ ] Analytics and feedback system
- [ ] Conversation flow

### Next Steps

- [ ] Enhance agent UI with better conversation management
- [ ] Implement full containerization with Docker
- [ ] Add support for agent tools and API connections
- [ ] Expand analytics and feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Create marketplace for sharing agents
- [ ] Implement automated triggers for agents
